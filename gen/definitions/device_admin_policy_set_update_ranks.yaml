name: Device Admin Policy Set Update Ranks
res_description:
  'This resource is used to bulk update rank field in device admin policy set. It serves as a workaround for the 
  ISE API/Backend limitation which restricts rank assignments to a strictly incremental sequence.
  By utilizing this resource and device_admin_policy_set resource, you can bypass the APIs limitation.
  Creation of this resource is performing PUT operation (Update) and it only tracks rank field.
  When this resource is destroyed, no action is performed on ISE and resource is just removed from state.'
