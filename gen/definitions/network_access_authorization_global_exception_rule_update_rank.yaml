name: Network Access Authorization Global Exception Rule Update Rank
res_description:
  'This resource is used to update rank field in network access authorization global exception rule. It serves as a workaround for the 
  ISE API/Backend limitation which restricts rank assignments to a strictly incremental sequence.
  By utilizing this resource and network_access_authorization_global_exception_rule resource, you can bypass the APIs limitation.
  Creation of this resource is performing PUT operation (Update) and it only tracks rank field.
  When this resource is destroyed, no action is performed on ISE and resource is just removed from state.'
