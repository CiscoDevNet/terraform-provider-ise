  This resource is used to update rank field in network access authentication rule. It serves as a workaround for the ISE API/Backend limitation which restricts rank assignments to a strictly incremental sequence. By utilizing this resource and network_access_authentication_rule resource, you can bypass the APIs limitation. Creation of this resource is performing PUT operation (Update) and it only tracks rank field. When this resource is destroyed, no action is performed on ISE and resource is just removed from state.

# ise_network_access_authentication_rule_update_rank (Resource)

This resource is used to update rank field in network access authentication rule. It serves as a workaround for the ISE API/Backend limitation which restricts rank assignments to a strictly incremental sequence. By utilizing this resource and network_access_authentication_rule resource, you can bypass the APIs limitation. Creation of this resource is performing PUT operation (Update) and it only tracks rank field. When this resource is destroyed, no action is performed on ISE and resource is just removed from state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ise_network_access_authentication_rule_update_rank" "example" {
  auth_rule_id              = "9b3680da-0165-44f6-9cff-88e778d98020"
  policy_set_id             = "d82952cb-b901-4b09-b363-5ebf39bdbaf9"
  name                      = "Rule1"
  default                   = false
  rank                      = 0
  state                     = "enabled"
  condition_type            = "ConditionAttributes"
  condition_is_negate       = false
  condition_attribute_name  = "Location"
  condition_attribute_value = "All Locations"
  condition_dictionary_name = "DEVICE"
  condition_operator        = "equals"
  identity_source_name      = "Internal Endpoints"
  if_auth_fail              = "REJECT"
  if_process_fail           = "DROP"
  if_user_not_found         = "REJECT"
}
```

- `if_auth_fail` (String) Action to perform when authentication fails such as Bad credentials, disabled user and so on
  - Choices: `REJECT`, `DROP`, `CONTINUE`
- `if_process_fail` (String) Action to perform when ISE is uanble to access the identity database
  - Choices: `REJECT`, `DROP`, `CONTINUE`
- `if_user_not_found` (String) Action to perform when user is not found in any of identity stores
  - Choices: `REJECT`, `DROP`, `CONTINUE`

- `condition_attribute_name` (String) Dictionary attribute name
- `condition_attribute_value` (String) Attribute value for condition. Value type is specified in dictionary object.
- `condition_dictionary_name` (String) Dictionary name
- `condition_dictionary_value` (String) Dictionary value
- `condition_id` (String) UUID for condition
- `condition_is_negate` (Boolean) Indicates whereas this condition is in negate mode
